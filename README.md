# Quarto_BoardGame
A board game that I'm adapting for playing with my sister on LAN

## About
Quarto is a board game for two players invented by Swiss mathematician Blaise MÃ¼ller. More information you can find at **.[Quarto's wikipedia page]**.

## Rules
You can easily find information about how to play the game on the internet by searching for ```Quarto board game```` on the internet, but in the future I'm thinking of providing a simple Instruction's Manual.
